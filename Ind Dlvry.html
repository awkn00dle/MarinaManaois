				<blockquote>
					<p>This is a Refocus Task. As a data analyst in an Indian delivery company, I have been tasked by
						top management to create a report on delivery time to
						compare the company's performance with competitors in Asia. The report will use data from a .csv
						file that includes information such as delivery time, order date,
						traffic, weather, location, and other relevant factors. The company delivers various items,
						including entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, and groceries, using cars, bikes, or motorized
						scooters, depending on the location.
						The report will aid in expanding the company's business to other countries in Asia.</p>

				<h2>Power BI Dashboard</h2>
				<p>This dashboard presents key performance indicators, including the longest
					delivery time, median delivery time, and total number of deliveries as specified by management.
					These metrics are displayed in number cards that dynamically adjust as users apply various filters
					available on the left-hand side of the dashboard. The right side of the dashboard features a
					comparison of average delivery time during different weather conditions and modes of transportation
					(i.e., motorcycle vs. scooter) to help address the business question of which mode of transportation
					is more efficient in larger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together. The center of
					the dashboard features a map of India, showing the total number of deliveries per city type
					(semi-urban, metropolitan, urban). Additionally, a timeline shows the total number of deliveries
					over the period of analysis, which can be further filtered by day of the week and month.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<h3>Dataset Review</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/dlvry1.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Upon reviewing the dataset in Excel, I have determined the necessary metrics for the analysis.
					Utilizing the "ids" column, I will generate a "DeliveryCount" metric, while the order dates will
					form the basis of a timeseries graph. In order to focus solely on the information related to
					location, weather, vehicle type, and lead time, I will exclude irrelevant columns such as
					"Delivery_person_ID", "Delivery_person_Age", and "Delivery_person_Ratings". The "Vehicle_condition"
					integer and "Festival" binary columns will also be dropped. Additionally, I have identified a range
					of filters to be incorporated into the dashboard, including "Order Type", "Traffic Density",
					"Vehicle Type", "Weather Type", "Delivery Type", and "City Type".</p>
				<h3>Data Processing</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/dlvry2.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>From there, the dataset was imported into Power BI and was transformed for data processing or
					cleaning.
					This includes simple tasks such as removing duplicates, removing unnecessary columns,
					replacing blank values as "No Data", and creating buckets. </p>
				<h3>Data Modeling</h3>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dlvry3.png"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
					<p></p>
				<p>For data modeling, a dimension table was created solely for the timeseries. These tables were
					connected by "Order Date" from the Fact table and "Date" from the Dim Table.
				<blockquote>These were the formulas used:
					<li>New Table. Column 1:
						<code>DimCalendar = CALENDAR(MIN(FACTTable.Column), MAX(FACTTable.Column))</code></li>
					<li>Column 2: <code>DayOfWeek = FORMAT(DIMTable.Column, "DDDD")</code></li>
					<li>Column 3: <code>Month = FORMAT(DIMTable.Column, "MMM")</code></li>
					<li>Column 4: <code>Quarter = "Q"&QUARTER(DIMTable.Column) </code></li>
					<li>Column 5: <code>Year = YEAR(Table.Column) </code></li>
				</blockquote>
