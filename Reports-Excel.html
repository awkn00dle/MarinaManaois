							<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/rprt1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The Profit and Loss Excel report template dashboard I created provides a comprehensive view of a business's financial performance. Featuring a pivot table, graphs displaying income and expenses per month for 2023, and slicers for easy data filtering, the dashboard can assist businesses in recognizing trends, comparing monthly performance, and making informed decisions. Connected to a hidden table for easy updating, users can identify profitable areas, analyze expense impact, and improve financial performance. The dashboard's intuitive design ensures ease of comprehension, enabling businesses to make informed decisions on spending, revenue-generating activities, and areas for improvement. 
								A valuable tool for small businesses seeking financial improvement. </p>

Hidden tabs in the Excel file show the breakdown of each expense and the varying percentages each dentist needs to contribute. The pie graph reveals the expense distribution, and the stacked bar graph shows the monthly expense breakdown. This dashboard allows dentists to monitor spending, reduce costs, and make informed decisions to optimize expenses and improve their clinic's financial performance. The intuitive design and easy-to-read graphs provide an accessible way to identify areas for improvement.</p>
