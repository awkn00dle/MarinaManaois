				<blockquote>This is a Refocus Project that involves team effort to analyze HR data as
					requested by a stakeholder using tools, such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI. By the end of the case
					study, the group
					created an interactive dashboard and video presentation report to answer business questions.
				</blockquote>
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The HR department of a medical company tasked a data analyst team with identifying the most
					disciplined and undisciplined employees and departments, analyzing the reasons for employee absence
					and tardiness, and determining which heads of departments tend to forgive employee lack of
					discipline. Inconsistent data formatting required pre-cleaning of CSV files in MS Excel before
					importing them into PostgreSQL. Data cleaning involved replacing empty values, unnesting arrays, and
					removing duplicates. Data was then imported into Power BI for further processing and analysis.
					Recommendations included implementing clearer tardiness and sanction policies, creating a reward
					system for punctual employees, and improving data gathering by adding more data points and
					undertaking further analysis to identify specific problem areas.
				</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I was part of a data analyst team for the HR department in a medical company.
					The data provided by the HR department includes 10-15 parameters per day per year
					(arrival/departure time, vacations, sick days, time off, etc) on 1000+ employees of the
					company. The group needed to do the following tasks, which the CEO requested: identify the most
					disciplined and undisciplined employees and divisions, create a visualization with the analysis of
					weekdays and months when the most employees were late/absent (either for vacation or sick leave),
					and answer the following
					questions: Which heads of departments tend to forgive employees for lack of discipline? Are there
					any favorites for any heads of
					departments (perhaps some employees are always forgiven for being late, given
					time off, etc.)?</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>Objectives</h2>
				<p>The team had access to a dataset containing information on employee attendance, leave requests,
					payroll, schedules, and employee information. With this data, the group
					established team objectives for the analysis on employee attendance and leaves:</p>
				<li>Find out who are the most disciplined and undisciplined employees and divisions.</li>
				<li>Pinpoint which weekdays and months that has the most leaves and absences.</li>
				<li>Investigate whether there are favorites within the departments.</li>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<h3>Pre-Cleaning</h3>
				<p>Upon inspection of dataset, it was noticed that some of these cannot be directly imported to
					PostgreSQL due to
					inconsistencies in data formatting, specifically the array within some of the columns.
					MS Excel was used to perform pre-cleaning of CSV files by changing array square brackets to curly
					braces.</p>

						<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-9"><span class="image fit"><img src="./images/clck2.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p></p>
						<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
						<p>After importing the dataset in PostgreSQL, each table were made a copy or backup in case
							errors or mistakes were to occur. The data was then cleaned by replacing empty values to
							with “not specified”, unnesting those with arrays, and removing duplicated rows.</p>

						<p>As a sample, these are some of the SQL scripts for data cleaning. To view all scripts in
							detail you may visit this link: <i><a

								<p>Changing null values</p>
								<p></p>
								<h3>Analyze</h3>
								<p>The datasets were imported into Power BI where further data processing was made, like
									merging attendance and schedule tables and removed outliers. Data analysis was
									initiated once calculations with DAX metrics (Add Column) were made. A dimenstion
									calendar table was also made with the use of MIN and MAX on
									attendance_schedule merged table.</p>
								<blockquote>Below are some DAX column measures:
									<li>is_disciplined <code>= IF([is_undertime_or_late] = 0, 1, 0)</code></li>
									<li>is_late
										<code>= IF([case] = "IN", IF([undertime_duration_minute] > 10, 1, 0), 0)</code>
									</li>
									<li>is_undertime
										<code>= IF([case] = "OUT", IF([undertime_duration_minute] > 0, 1, 0), 0)</code>
									</li>
									<li>late_duration_hour
										<code>= IF([case] = "IN", DATEDIFF([schedules.time_start], [time], HOUR), 0)</code>
									</li>

																<h2>Recommendations</h2>
																<h4>Establish clearer tardiness policies for full-time
																	employees
																</h4>
																<li>Attendance policy is needed in an organization when
																	frequent employee
																	absences and tardiness are causing disturbance in
																	the business. </li>
																<li>To deal with employee issues, time and attendance
																	policy is needed.</li>

																<p></p>
																<h4>Create a sanction policy for undisciplined employees
																</h4>
																<li>Effective working in an organization depends on the
																	punctuality, sincerity, and
																	regular working of the employees, and to a certain
																	extent on employee
																	attendance.</li>
																<li>It is necessary to lay down rules and regulations
																	which are followed within the
																	organization to maintain regularity.</li>
																<li>Point system is one of the ways to keep control of
																	discipline related to employee
																	attendance and to communicate that an absence cannot
																	be taken casually and
																	regular absence or tardiness or absenteeism will be
																	dealt with strict disciplinary
																	action.</li>
																<li>It is recommended that unauthorized absences should
																	be handled with a
																	succession of warning, which, if ignored may result
																	in a disciplinary hearing.</li>
																<li>If the employee continues unauthorized absence, it
																	is a gross misconduct, then
																	the employee may be dismissed for that.</li>
																<p></p>
																<h4>Reward system for consistently punctual employees
																</h4>
																<li>Recognizing employees for good attendance and
																	performance can be one of the
																	lowest cost, yet highest impact strategies for your
																	business.
																</li>
																<li>Find a way to call out and reward good attendance on
																	a regular basis. </li>
																<li>Incentivize rewards with good attendance record. An
																	idea could be offering
																	rewards they would not want to miss, like an extra
																	day off or a chance to choose
																	their own schedule for a week.</li>
																<p></p>
																<h4>Improve data gathering</h4>
																<li>Add data points on leave requests, e.g., reasons for
																	granting compensatory
																	leave.</li>
																<li>For those who clocked in late, collect the reasons
																	for their tardiness.</li>
																<li>Create a separate data collection system for
																	freelancers and full-time workers.</li>
																<li>Collect data on whether they gave sanctions to
																	undisciplined employees.</li>
																<li>Research the issue by undertaking a historical study
																	to ascertain the extent of
																	the attendance problem and whether it is improving
																	or worsening. </li>
																<li>Further analysis can help pinpoint specific problem
																	areas, such as geographic
																	locations, departments or divisions experiencing
																	higher-than-usual absence
																	rates.</li>
