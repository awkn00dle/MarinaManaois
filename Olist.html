				<h1 class="major">Olist eCommerce Data Visualization</h1>
				<blockquote>This is a Refocus Final Task. As a data analyst consultant for an e-commerce company in
					Brazil, I have
					been tasked with analyzing their operational performance using a dataset of 100,000 orders from
					various marketplaces between 2016 and 2018. The report I am required to produce will consist of
					three main parts: a general dashboard, delivery performance, and product quality. The dataset
					contains information on customer location, product attributes, order status, price, payment, and
					freight performance. Additionally, customer reviews and a geolocation dataset linking Brazilian zip
					codes to latitude/longitude coordinates are available. The report's findings will influence the
					company's management decisions regarding future business development. The dataset is commercially
					sensitive and has been anonymized.</blockquote>
				<h3>General Dashboard</h3>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">

					<h3>Delivery Performance Dashboard</h3>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-9"><span class="image fit"><img src="./images/olist-del.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>

						<h3>Product Quality Dashboard</h3>
						<div class="box alt">
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-9"><span class="image fit"><img src="./images/olist-prod.png"
											alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
							<h2>Business Objectives</h2>
							<p>The general dashboard will be established after the business metrics of delivery
								performance and product quality are planned out. The following bullet points and its
								sequence are part of my thought process before creating the dashboards:</p>
							<h4>Delivery Performance</h4>
							<li>Analyzing the Order Lead Time (OLT), we can identify
								if the
								e-commerce platform is meeting customer expectations of timely delivery. A longer
								OLT may lead to customer dissatisfaction and impact customer loyalty. </li>
							<li>Analyzing the Carrier Delivery Time (CDT), we can identify if the carriers are
								delivering the orders
								within the expected time frame. A longer CDT may indicate inefficiencies in the
								carrier's delivery processes and may require attention.</li>
							<li>Comparing the OLT and Estimated Delivery Time (EDT), we can identify if the
								e-commerce platform is
								delivering the orders as per the promised delivery timeline. A longer OLT than EDT
								may indicate delivery delays and require corrective actions.</li>
							<p></p>
							<blockquote>
								Key metrics: <li>Average freight cost per order</li>
								<li>Total Orders or Deliveries</li>
								<li>Average delivery/processing time</li>
								<li>Average Customer Delivery Time</li>
								<li>Average Courier Delivery Time</li>
							</blockquote>
							<h4>Product Quality</h4>
							<li>Product ratings and reviews provide valuable feedback on customer satisfaction and
								quality. High ratings and positive reviews indicate quality products while low ratings
								and negative reviews highlight areas for improvement. Monitor and take action to address
								customer feedback.</li>
							<li>Monitoring product popularity and demand helps understand which products are most
								popular with customers, informing inventory management and development decisions.
								Popular products may require additional production or inventory while less popular
								products may need reevaluation to better meet customer preferences.</li>
							<li>Monitoring the average price of products helps to understand competitor pricing and
								ensure competitiveness. Balance pricing with quality and customer demand to offer
								products at a reasonable price point. Investigate the relationship between product price
								and quality, identifying opportunities to improve quality without significant price
								increases.</li>
							<p> </p>
							<blockquote> Key metrics
								<li>Total Number of Products</li>
								<li>Total Revenue</li>
								<li>Average Price per Order</li>
								<li>Average Review Rating</li>
								<li>No. of Orders that rated 4-5 stars</li>
								<li>No. of Orders that rated 1-3 stars</li>
							</blockquote>
							<h4>General Dashboard</h4>
							Key metrics
							<li>Total revenue</li>
							<li>Total revenue generated over time</li>
							<li>Number of orders</li>
							<li>Number of orders placed and fulfilled</li>
							<li>Average order value Average value of each order</li>
							<li>Number of customers and their distribution across different regions</li>
							<li>Sales by product categories Sales distribution by product categories</li>
							<li>Sales by sellers</li>
							<li>Sales distribution by sellers</li>
							<li>Review scores Average review scores and sentiments</li>

							<h2>Methodology</h2>
							<h3>Data Cleaning & Processing</h3>
							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="./images/olist5.png"
												alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
								<p></p>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="./images/olist6.png"
													alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
									<p></p>
									<p>There are nine (9) datasets. Above is a sample of only the Fact Table which is
										titled "olist_orders_dataset".
										Upon reviewing the dataset in Excel, I have determined the necessary metrics for
										the analysis. Utilizing the "ids" column, I will generate a "OrderCount"
										metric, while the order dates will form the basis of a timeseries graph for the
										delivery dashboard. Almost all the columns were used in this project. However,
										the usual data cleaning such as removing duplicate rows, replace null to "No
										Data", promoting headers, adding measures (ex. Order Lead Time and Dates), and
										creating buckets were done as part of the processing of data. I also renamed the
										Dimension Tables and Fact Tables accordingly for easy data modeling.</p>
									<h3>Data Modeling</h3>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-7"><span class="image fit"><img src="./images/olist8.png"
														alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
										<p></p>
										<p>Above shows the data modeling schema I used, which is called a snowflake
											schema. I used Many-To-One for all entity-relationship diagrams (ERD). </p>
										<p></p>
										<h3>Dashboard Design</h3>
										<p>Below shows the visual elements in Power BI and the fields assigned to them.
