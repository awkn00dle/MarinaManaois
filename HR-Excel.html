				<h1 class="major">HR Recruitment Data Tracker</h1>
				<blockquote>
					<p>This is a Work Project done while I was an HR recruiter in my previous company. The information
						in this project is dummy data and are used solely to showcase a sample of the tracker.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p></p>
				<h2>Excel Table & Header Dashboard</h2>
				<p>The recruitment tracker has an interactive dashboard comprising three distinct components. The first
					component is a table that displays the various stages or levels of recruitment that candidates are
					required to go through. The second component includes a set of numerical tiles and a pipeline chart
					that
					present key
					recruitment metrics in a concise manner. The third component is a date card that shows the next
					onboarding date to help recruiters stay on track with the recruitment process. The dashboard's
					interactivity is enhanced by the option to toggle between the total number of applicants and the
					ratio of applicants that have completed each stage. This dashboard is designed to provide an
					easy-to-use and accessible way for recruiters to keep track of recruitment progress, manage their
					time efficiently, and remember the current status of each applicant.</p>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<h3>Tables</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit1.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>The main table is displayed above. The recruiter is responsible for providing details concerning
					the candidate, such as the applied job position, dates of application for each stage, the
					application source, and the onboarding date for the selected candidate. The "Stage" and "Status"
					columns are cells that have been formatted and their function will be elaborated on at a later
					point. </p>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit2.png" alt="" /></span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p></p>
					<p>These tables above are located in the Calculation Sheet. They are tables used for data validation
						in
						creating the lists for columns: "Job Title", "Reject Reason", and "Source". This is to eliminate
						typing and provide a drop-down selection tool for the user.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Name Manager</h3>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit3.png"
										alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
						<p></p>
						<p>To make formulas easier to type out, the Name Manager option is used. Values under columns
							such
							as "Applicant_id" are named "L_APPS" when formulating the total number of applications (ex.
							COUNT(L_APPS)) </p>
						<p></p>
						<h3>Logical Formulas</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit4.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>For the "Stage" column, a formula was used to indicate the application status
							based on the last column the recruiter has updated. Example would be if the recruiter
							selected "Scheduled" under column "L2" or "Level 2 Interview", then the "Stage" would
							indicate "Lvl 2".</p>
						<blockquote>The "Stage" formula used:
							<code>=IFS([@[Onboarding DT]]>0,$C$5,[@OFFER]>0,$C$4,[@FINAL]>0,$C$3,[@[L4 (optional)]]>0,$C$2,[@L3]>0,$B$5,[@L2]>0,$B$4,[@L1]>0,$B$3,[@[APPLIED DATE]]>0,$B$2)</code>
						</blockquote>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit5.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>For the "Status" column, a formula was used to indicate whether the application is "Closed"
							or "Open". The recruiter would need to add a selection under "Reject Reason" in order for
							the "Status" to close. Additonally, if under the "Offer" column, the cell indicates
							"Scheduled" then the "Status" is Open. If the "Offer" is "Declined" or "Accepted" the
							"Status" is Closed.</p>
						<blockquote>The "Stage" formula used:
							<code>=IFS([@[Reject Reason]]>0,"CLOSED",[@OFFER]="ACCEPTED","CLOSED",[@OFFER]="DECLINED","CLOSED",[@OFFER]="SCHEDULED","OPEN",[@OFFER]="","OPEN")</code>
						</blockquote>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<h3>Conditional Formatting</h3>
						<div class="box alt">
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit6.png"
											alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
							<p></p>
							<p>The conditional formatting manager was used to help the recruiter easily indicate whether
								an
								applicant has passed (green), failed (red), or is about to be scheduled (yellow).</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>Dashboard with Filters</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit8.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>To create the Pipeline Chart, two tables were first created for total number of
								applications per stage and the percentage of applications per stage. The tables located
								in the Calculation Sheet were then
								used to generate the Pipeline Chart that could switch between "Total" and "Percentage"
								based on user selection through a drop-down menu. The drop-down
								selection was created with input and cell link in developer mode.</p>
							<blockquote>The formula used for linking either the "Total" (1) or "Percentage" (2) table:
								<code>=HLOOKUP($J$6,$R$14:$S$20,ROW()-13,0)</code>
							</blockquote>
							<p></p>
							<h3>Dashboard with Number Cards</h3>
							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/hr-recruit7.png"
												alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>To calculate the average processing time (days), a new table which includes the
										Level 1 (date) column and the Final Intervieww (date) column from the Tracker.
										The dates would need to be subtracted in order to get the difference. The
										applicants who didn't reach the Final Interview would have values lower than 0
										(e.g. -44900). A formula was used to replace values lower than 0 as "0" and
										those higher than 0 will be as its orginal values.</p>
										<blockquote>These were the formulas used:<code>=IF(W1<0,"0",W1)</code></li>
										</blockquote>
										<p>Creating
											number cards for a dashboard involves
											setting up a table in the Calculations
											Sheet with formulas to calculate the total applications, total active
											applications, and average processing time in days.
											Cards were designed, labeled, and linked to the table's values, including the
											upcoming onboarding date.</p>
									<blockquote>These were the formulas used:
										<li>Total Applications <code>=COUNTA(L_APPS)</code></li>
										<li>Active Applications <code>=COUNTIF(P_Status,"OPEN")</code></li>
										<li>Average Processing Time (Days)
											<code>=AVERAGE(ProcessingTime)</code>
										</li>
										<li>Upcoming Onboarding Date:
											<code>=MIN(IF(Onboarding_DT>=todays.date,Onboarding_DT))</code>
										</li>
