				<h1 class="major">Huawei-Google Play Data Visualization</h1>
				<blockquote>This is a Refocus Task. I was a data analyst working at Huawei, specifically in the
					AppGallery vertical. My manager has
					an important business review coming up soon and is tying a presentation together.
					He wanted me to make a report in Power BI out of Google’s Play Store dataset (which
					is sent to me via email). He’s looking to use this report during his business review
					to find and talk through competitor insights together with the leadership team
					that’s attending. </blockquote>

				<h2>Power BI Dashboard</h2>
				<p>This dashboard presents key metrics, including the total number of apps, total number
					of installs, the average review rating, and the total number of installs from free and paid apps
					separately. These metrics are
					displayed in number cards that dynamically adjust as users interact with the other graphs and
					filters. The graphs goes deeper into the analysis by showcasing details about reviews, rating,
					price, and apps by
					app size. Additionally, a timeline shows the total number of
					apps last updated over the period of analysis,
					which can be further filtered by date slicer.</p>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<h3>Dataset Review</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hwei1.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Upon reviewing the dataset in Excel, I have determined the necessary metrics for the analysis.
					Utilizing the "app" column, I generated a "AppCount" metric, while the last update dates will
					form the basis of a timeseries graph. In order to focus solely on the information related to
					installs, reviews, and price, I excluded irrelevant columns such as
					"Current Version" and "Andrioid Version". Additionally, I have identified somee
					filters to be incorporated into the dashboard, including "App" and "Category" selection option,
					"Free" and "Paid" selection option,
					and, finally, a Date filter.</p>
				<h3>Data Processing</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hwei2 (2).png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>From there, the dataset was imported into Power BI and was transformed for data processing or
					cleaning. This includes simple tasks such as removing duplicates, removing unnecessary columns,
					replacing blank values as "No Data", and creating buckets.</p>
				<h3>Data Modeling</h3>
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/hwei8.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
					<p></p>
					<p>For data modeling, a dimension table was created solely for the timeseries. These tables were
						connected by "Last Updated" from the Fact table and "Date" from the newly made Dim Table.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Dashboard Design</h3>
					<p>Below shows the visual elements in Power BI and the fields assigned to them.</p>
