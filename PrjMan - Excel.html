				<blockquote>This is a Personal Project to exercise my knowledge and skills in advanced Excel. This
					project management report comprises of an interactive dashboard offers essential metrics,
					upcoming activities, KPIs, and a Gantt chart, facilitating easy task management and providing
					insights into individual contributions. Moreover, tmarnahhhe information
					in this project is dummy data and are used solely to showcase a sample of the report.</p></blockquote>

				<h2>Excel Interactive Dashboard</h2>
				<p>This project management report created in Excel features an interactive dashboard with four distinct
					components. The first part includes a set of number tiles
					that display essential project metrics at a glance. The second part is a table that shows the
					upcoming activities and pending issues for each project,
					allowing users to easily stay on top of their tasks. The third component is a KPI table that
					showcases the performance of each project member,
					providing valuable insights into individual contributions. The final part is a project status Gantt
					chart that offers an overview of each project's progress.
					The interactive nature of the dashboard is enhanced by its ability to toggle between a list of
					upcoming activities or issues and a slicer for choosing the progress of each
					project team. This dashboard offers an accessible and user-friendly way to track the status of
					projects and make informed decisions.</p>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<h3>Pivot Table</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/prjman-piv.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Created a pivot table that involved connecting the "teams" and "activities" reference tables through
					the "persons" column.
					Start and end dates were added as minimum and maximum values,
					and the "category" and "activities" columns were included to categorize the results.
					The end result was a table that displayed activity numbers, individual start and end dates, and
					categories.</p>
				<h3>Gantt Chart</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/prjman-gant.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>To create the Gantt chart, the prepared pivot table was linked to a vertical axis on a separate
					sheet.
					Progress percentages were converted to progress bars using conditional formatting,
					and a timeline calendar was created as a horizontal axis. Formulas were used to determine whether
					activities were ongoing,
					with true cells colored light orange and false cells left blank. Finally, conditional formatting was
					used to highlight today's date on the timeline.
					The resulting chart provides an overview of each activity's completion status and whether projects
					are on schedule.</p>
				<h3>Progress Charts</h3>
				<h4>Upcoming Chart</h4>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/prjman-upc.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>To create the "Upcoming Chart", two tables were first created for the top 10 ongoing activities and
					top 10 pending issues on the calculations sheet.
					These tables were then used to generate a dashboard display table that could switch between the list
					of activities and issues based on user selection through a drop-down menu.
					The drop-down selection was created with input and cell link in developer mode.</p>
				<blockquote>These were the formulas used:
					<li>Upcoming Activities:
						<code>=INDEX(FILTER(Activities,Activities[Start Date]>today.date),SEQUENCE(10),{1,2,4})</code>
					</li>
					<li>Pending Issues:
						<code>=INDEX(FILTER(Issue,Issue[Date opened]>today.date),SEQUENCE(10),{1,2,4})</code></li>
					<li>Dashboard Table:
						<code>=INDEX(FILTER(Issue,Issue[Date opened]>today.date),SEQUENCE(10),{1,2,4})</code></li>
				</blockquote>
				<h4>People Chart</h4>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/prjman-ppl.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>To create "People Chart", the linking of the "Activity" and "People" tables was made by using the
					relationship option.
					A pivot table was created to count "Assigned To" for activities and "Owner" for issues.
					Data bars were added via conditional formatting, and the table was copied to the dashboard.</p>
				<h3>Dashboard with Filters</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/prjman-slcr.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>To create an interactive dashboard, two filters were added: a drop-down for the Upcoming Chart and a
					slicer for the Gantt Chart.
					A combo box was inserted using the developer's tab and linked to a calculation sheet with the two
					drop-down options.
					This method allows for dynamic and user-friendly data exploration.</p>
				<p>To create a slicer for the Gantt Chart, the pivot table field was opened, and the team table was
					selected and added as a slicer by right-clicking.
					The slicer was then linked to the dashboard,
					allowing for easy filtering of the Gantt Chart.</p>
				<h3>Dashboard with Number Cards</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/prjman-crds.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Creating number cards for a dashboard involves setting up a new table in the calculations sheet with
					formulas to calculate days left for projects, pending activities, and issues.
					Cards were designed, labeled,
					and linked to the table's values, including today's date.</p>
				<blockquote>These were the formulas used:
					<li>Days Left: <code>=MAX(Activities[End Date]-today.date)</code></li>
					<li>Activities Pending:
						<code>=COUNTIFS(Activities[Start Date],"<="&today.date,Activities[% Done],"<1")</code></li>
					<li>Issues Pending: <code>=COUNTIFS(Issue[Date Closed],"")</code></li>
